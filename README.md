Songpipe is an public audio library featuring artists' original song versions, but also unexpected covers and live versions. Expect something different each time.

Files are pulled from last.fm data using python and stored in JSON libraries.

Visualizations created using D3 libraries and coffee scripts. Interactivity with jquery.

Google Analytics code tracks song-play, play-end, and stall/error audio cases. Can track plays by song and artist.

Currently not great UX on tablet and phone.
